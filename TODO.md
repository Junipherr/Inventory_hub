  - Improved touch experience for mobile devices
  - Enhanced table scrolling and mobile optimization
  - Better button sizing for touch screens

## Current Implementation Details

### Breakpoint Strategy:
- **Extra Small (<576px)**: Minimal columns shown, horizontal scrolling enabled
- **Small (576px-767px)**: More columns visible, improved button layout
- **Medium (768px-991px)**: Most columns visible, compact layout
- **Large (992px-1199px)**: Full desktop experience with all columns

### Column Visibility:
1. **Always Visible**: ID, User, Item, Status, Actions
2. **Hidden on XS**: Return Date, Quantity, Purpose, Requested Date
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Columns appear as screen size increases

### Mobile Enhancements:
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px for touch targets)
- Horizontal scrolling for table with smooth scrolling
- Improved empty state styling for mobile
- Better pagination layout on small screens

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Consider adding a card-based mobile view alternative
- [ ] Optimize for very large screens if needed
- [ ] Add loading states for mobile performance

## Files Modified:
- `resources/views/custodian/borrow-requests/index.blade.php`
- `public/assets/css/custodian-borrow-requests.css`

The implementation uses Bootstrap's built-in responsive utilities rather than DataTables, focusing on a clean, mobile-friendly experience that maintains all functionality across devices.
