Custodian Inventory Management System - User Guide
===============================================

This guide provides instructions for using the Custodian Inventory Management System. The system supports two main user roles: Admin and Viewer. Admins have full access to manage items, users, and borrow requests. Viewers can view items, update statuses (if permitted), and submit borrow requests.

1. How to Log In
================

To access the system:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to https://paccustodian.online/.
2. Click on the "Login" link or navigate to /login.
3. Enter your registered email address and password.
4. Click the "Log In" button.
5. If email verification is required, check your email and click the verification link.

Note: If you don't have an account, contact your administrator to create one for you. Password reset is available via the "Forgot Password" link.

2. How to Add Items (Admin Only)
=================================

Admins can add new items to the inventory:

1. Log in as an Admin user.
2. Navigate to the Dashboard (/dashboard).
3. Click on "Inventory" in the navigation menu, then select "Create Item" (/inventory/create).
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - Item Name: The name of the item
   - Room: Select the room where the item is located
   - Category: Choose or enter a category (e.g., furniture, equipment)
   - Description: Optional detailed description
   - Quantity: Number of items
   - QR Code: Optional, will be auto-generated if left blank
   - Purchase Date: Optional
   - Purchase Price: Optional
   - Warranty Expires: Optional
   - Condition: Optional (e.g., good, fair, poor)
5. Click "Save" to add the item.
6. The system will create a default unit for the item and redirect you back to the items list.

Note: All fields except QR code are required. The system validates input and shows error messages if validation fails.

3. How to Update Items (Admin Only)
====================================

Admins can edit existing items:

1. Log in as an Admin user.
2. Go to the Inventory Items page (/inventory/items).
3. Find the item you want to update in the list (use search if needed).
4. Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) next to the item (/inventory/items/{id}/edit).
5. Modify the fields as needed (same as add item form).
6. Click "Update" to save changes.
7. The system will validate and update the item, then redirect to the items list.

Note: You can also update items directly from the dashboard by clicking on room categories and selecting items.

4. How to Manage Room Inventories
==================================

Managing room inventories involves viewing, scanning, and updating item statuses:

For Admins:
1. Log in as an Admin.
2. Access the Dashboard (/dashboard) to see an overview of all rooms and their items.
3. Click on a room to view its categories and items.
4. Use the Scanner feature (/scanner) to physically check items:
   - Scan QR codes using your device's camera or enter manually.
   - Update item statuses (e.g., available, borrowed, damaged).
   - Save changes to record the last checked date.

For Viewers (if permitted):
1. Log in as a Viewer.
2. Access your Viewer Dashboard (/viewer/dashboard).
3. View items in your assigned room.
4. If you have update permissions, use the scanner to check and update item statuses.

Note: Only users with "can_update_status" permission can modify item statuses. Contact your admin if you need this permission.

5. How to Approve/Decline Borrow Requests (Admin Only)
=======================================================

Admins can manage borrow requests from viewers:

1. Log in as an Admin.
2. Navigate to "Borrow Requests" in the admin section (/admin/borrow-requests).
3. View all requests or filter by status (pending, approved, rejected).
4. For pending requests:
   - Click "View Details" to see the full request information.
   - Review the item availability and request details.
   - Click "Approve" to approve the request (if sufficient quantity is available).
   - Or click "Reject" and provide a reason for rejection.
5. For approved requests, you can mark them as "Returned" when items are returned.

Note: The system automatically checks available quantities before approving requests. You cannot approve requests that exceed available stock.

6. How to Export
================

Currently, the system supports exporting inventory data as Word documents:

1. Log in as an Admin.
2. Go to the Dashboard (/dashboard).
3. For a specific room, click the "Export" button or navigate to /export/word/{roomId}.
4. The system will generate a Memorandum Receipt document in Word format.
5. Download and save the file.

Note: CSV export/import functionality is not currently available. Contact your system administrator for future enhancements or custom export options.

Additional Notes:
- Always ensure you have the necessary permissions for actions (Admin role required for most management tasks).
- Use the search functionality on the items page to quickly find specific items.
- QR codes are automatically generated for items and can be used for quick scanning.
- Borrow requests help track item usage and ensure accountability.
- Regular inventory checks using the scanner help maintain accurate records.

For technical support or questions about specific features, contact your system administrator.
