# Mobile Menu Implementation - Fixed

## âœ… Issue Resolved:

The mobile menu was disappearing because of Bootstrap collapse functionality conflicts. The implementation has been simplified to match the approach used in `welcome.blade.php`.

### Changes Made:

1. **Simplified JavaScript**: Removed Bootstrap collapse dependency and used simple display toggling
2. **Updated Layout**: Removed Bootstrap collapse attributes from HTML
3. **Fixed CSS**: Ensured proper default hiding of mobile menu

### New Implementation:
- Uses simple `display: none` / `display: block` toggling like welcome.blade.php
- No Bootstrap collapse conflicts
- Maintains all other functionality (backdrop, scrolling, click outside to close)
- Still copies sidebar content dynamically

### Testing Ready:
The mobile menu should now work reliably without disappearing issues. The implementation follows the same pattern as the working welcome.blade.php mobile menu.
